# FFmpeg + RTSP Integration

This repository contains scripts to redirect RTSP streams into MP4 file by using FFmpeg. It also contains script to move generate MP4 files to archive folder, clean them up after some days.

In my case, the MP4 stream files are under Nextcloud storage so I can view them in my private cloud. There are scripts to scan generated/moved/cleaned files in Nextcloud index.
